  Struct representing the DataChannel.

  All of the fields have the same meaning as in [RTCDataChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCDataChannel)
  except for `ref` which is a local identifier used when refering to this DataChannel in
  received messages or when calling `ExWebRTC.PeerConnection.send_data/3` function.

  It's worth to mention that `id` and `label` can be used by the other peer to identify the data
  channel, althought be careful as:
  * `label` does not have to be unique, channels can share a single label,
  * `id` is only assigned after the SCTP connection has been established (which means
  that DataChannels created before first negotiation will have `id` set to `nil`)
